# Example of data projections in neural networks
## Purpose:  
Explore how neural nets perform projections, transformations, and representations of data to perform binary classification tasks. 

## Methods:  
1. Generate a synthetic data set: a 2-dimensional set of features (X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub>) and a target variable, y, which is binary (class 0 or 1).
2. Force a relationship between X's and y; otherwise, it will be difficult to make predictions using just two features.
3. Build network. I chose to create this from scratch using resources from simple online tutorials...

**Number of Layers:** 3
**Layer structure:** 3 perceptrons -> 3 perceptrons -> 1 perceptron
**Inputs:** 2 
**Full network architecture:** 2 inputs -> 3-dimensional representation -> 3-dimensional representation -> 1-dimensional probability (for classification task)
